# DitheringTool
This is a quick tool I put together using Cursor Composer, originally I made a simpler version of this with Anthropicâ€™s Claude LLM and I wanted to try sharing existing code with Composer. Took a couple of corrections but I was able to add a couple of dithering algorithms, CSS styling and some file handling as well as schema for SEO and sharing. Atkinson and Bayer dithering are two pioneering techniques that brought life to early digital images, from classic computers to handheld gaming.
